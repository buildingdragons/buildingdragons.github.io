## Building Dragons. Together.

In May 2019, I decided to create a JavaFX application written entirely
in Scala. Being new to Scala and not very proficient in JavaFX, I knew
I quickly would become quite a pain in the backside of those who know way
better than me and are willing to offer help and guidance. 

To give something back to the community, I decided to make my work open so
everyone interested can follow my endeavor.

If there is anything you want to know and not addressed here, feel free to
open an issue, and I do my best to come back to you as soon as possible.

### And why dragons anyway?

In my imagination, Dragons are things challenging to create, and, even more,
challenging to handle. Building software from scratch is a complex process for
its own, but doing so using technology entirely new for the creator makes the
already complicated process difficult.

Another analogy could be Goethe's poem "The Sorcerer's Apprentice": The
apprentice of a sorcerer starts a process he barely understands and is not able
to handle or even stop without help from his mentor.

Since I do not like this poem very much, it almost comes to a bad end, and a
tamed Dragon could be a powerful and useful thing, I decided to keep with the
Dragon image.
